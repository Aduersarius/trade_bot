# value-based-deep-reinforcement-learning-trading-model-in-pytorch
This is a repo for deep reinforcement learning in trading. I used value based double DQN variant for single stock trading. The agent learn to make decision between selling, holding and buying stock with fixed amount based on the reward returned from the environment.
